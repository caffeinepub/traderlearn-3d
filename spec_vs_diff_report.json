  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive 3D trading education website with most requirements addressed. The backend Motoko actor is present with progress tracking, all four module pages are implemented, the navbar with glass-morphism is present, the 3D hero with React Three Fiber is implemented, 3D card navigation is present, and completion/progress features are wired up. However, the backend's data persistence across canister upgrades using stable storage appears unimplemented. A resetModule function was added to the backend that was not requested.",
